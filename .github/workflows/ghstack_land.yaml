# The land-command workflow runs ghstack land on the PR
#
# This workflow is triggered by leaving a "/land" comment on
# a pull request. If the required preconditions are met, it will
# merge a stack of PRs that includes the current one as well as
# all the PRs underneath it in the stack.
#
# Conditions are checked through the "ghstack-perm-check.py"
# python script defined in the .github/workflows/scripts folder.
#
# Condition for the "/land" command are:
# - the issuer is a maintainer (this is enforced by the "slash"
#   workflow, which verifies permissions before dispatching)
# - the current PR is in the format generated by ghstack
# - the current PR and all those underneath in the stack have no
#   failing check (this is limited to the GitHub check API, which
#   is used by GitHub Actions, it does not enforce commit statuses)
# - the current PR is approved
#
# The PRs are merged by a bot account "fms-cibot" which has push
# permissions on the repo.
#
# When a land is executed successfully, the horray emoji is added
# When a land execution fails, a comment is added with a link to the logs
